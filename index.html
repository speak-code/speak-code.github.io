    <h1>Here will be the grammar book for programming languages</h1>
    <p>The first exercise is <a href="hello">here</a>. I'll add more soon.</p>

    <h2>Do we even need it?</h2>

    <p>When I studied English, I had a book with hundreds of grammar exercises. It looked like this.</p>
    <img src="images/grammar.jpg">
    <p>It wasn't enough just to read the grammar rule once. I had to solve tons of exercises to install the rule into my brain.</p>
    <img src="images/excersises.jpg">

    <p>Learning Python doesn't differ too much from learning English. But for some reason people don't do enough grammar exercises in Python. They go straight to the big projects.</p>

    <p>I agree that projects are great. But making project without learning the grammar first is as painful as surviving in English-speaking country with just a dictionary (given that you don't know English). It is very difficult!</p>

    <p>So, we do need grammar books for programming languages.</p>


    <h2>What are you doing now?</h2>

    <p>I've tested embedding exercises from <a href="http://repl.it">repl.it</a> and it works! So now I'm developing the first set of exercises and some nice html and css to wrap them.</p>


    <h2>How can I help?</h2>

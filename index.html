  <h1>Here will be the grammar book for programming languages</h1>

  <h2>Do we even need it?</h2>

  <p>When I studied English, I had a book with hundreds of grammar excercises. It looked like this.</p>
  <img src="images/grammar.jpg">
  <p>It wasn't enought just to read the grammar rule once. I had to solve tons of excersises to install the rule into my brain.</p>

  <p>Learning Python doesn't differ too much from learning English. But for some reason people don't do enough grammar excersises in Python. They go straight to the big projects.</p>

  <p>I agree that projects are great. But making project without learning the grammar first is as paintful as surviving in English-speaking country with just a dictionary (given that you don't know English). It is very difficult!</p>

  <p>So, we do need grammar books for programming languages.</p>


  <h2>What are you going to do exactly?</h2>

  <p>I'm going to create a great set of grammar excercises for every programming language. This set will be free for everyone and curated by the open source community.</p>

  <p>
    The excerisises will require you to write a function
    <a href="http://codingbat.com/prob/p171896">
      like on codingbat</a>, or a programm
    <a href="http://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/785/E">
      like on codeforces</a>. The answer will be tested automatically.
  </p>

  
  <h2>What are you doing right now?</h2>

  <p>I'm creating the platform, which:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>provides a way to host and check the excersises</li>
    <li>is easy to contribute to</li>
    <li>is open source</li>
  </ul>
  
  
  <h2>How can I help?</h2>
  
  <p>You can help developing the platform. Look through the <a href="https://github.com/speak-code">speak-code repos</a> on github and find the one you'd like to contribute to.</p>
  
  <p>Also you can give me money <a href="https://www.patreon.com/speakcode">on patreon</a> to help me pay for the <a href="http://sphere-engine.com/">sphere-engine</a> I use for autotesting.</p>

  
  <h2>Mmm, who are you?</h2>
  
  <p>My name is Daria Kolodzey. I'm a girl from Russia and I interned as a software engineer at Google. I also have a personal website <a href="http://kolodzey.ru">kolodzey.ru</a> with links to my social media ;)
